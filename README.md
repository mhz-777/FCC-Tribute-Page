Skills Used:

* HTML5
* CSS

Project Specifications:


 *   Your tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements
 *   You should see an element with an id of title, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")
 *   You should see either a figure or a div element with an id of img-div
 *   Within the img-div element, you should see an img element with a corresponding id="image"
 *   Within the img-div element, you should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div
 *   You should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page
 *   You should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab
 *   Your #image should use max-width and height properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size
 *   Your img element should be centered within its parent element

New Things Learned:

* Mobile First Design
* CSS Reset Files (First heard about from Kevin Powell Youtube Channel)
* HTML semantic tags for accessibiltiy reasons

Challenges Faced:

* Responsive design (some elements still don't look right on certain screen sizes)
* Generally a better understanding of HTML and CSS since it is my first project ever created (woo-hoo!)
